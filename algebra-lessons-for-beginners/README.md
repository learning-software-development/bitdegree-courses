## Formulas

1. Area of a Rectangle `A = l * w`
2. Perimeter of a Rectangle `P = 2l + 2w`
3. Distance Traveled (Constant Rate) `D = r * t` rate times time
4. Cost `C = n * p` n is amount of item and p is price per item

## Euclidean Geometry

Euclid's Postulates

1. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any 2 points.
2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line.
3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius and one endpoint as center.
4. All right angles are concurrent.
5. If two lines are drawn which intersects a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.

## Simplified Rules

1. A straight line is the shortest possible line between two points.
2. Parallel lines are a constant distance from each other.
3. The angles in triangles always add up to 180
